  - Developed a dedicated system to calibrate the field response functions for the wire-readout-based single-phase Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC), enhancing TPC signal processing for automated event reconstruction.  
  - Contributed to MicroBooNE data analysis and provided critical inputs for protoDUNE and DUNE experiments.  
  - Constructed a LabVIEW-based DAQ program for LArFCS using commercial VME modules from CAEN, avoiding the complexity of the existing MicroBooNE NEVIS FPGA readout system.

- **Jul – Oct 2019: Geant4 Modelling for Nuclear Energy - Ubuntu Reactors**  
  - Developed a stochastic Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of a High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor (HTGCR) using the Geant4 framework.  
  - Implemented basic neutronics, geometrical discretization, time slicing, and intra-slice persistence for studying spatial variations of physical parameters.  
  - Integrated thermal hydraulics via workflow scheduling and validated thermal macroscopic cross-section behavior, fission, burn, decay, and differential energy deposition processes.  
  - Conducted validation of Xenon effects on neutronics, criticality, and core behavior over multiple time steps.

- **Nov 2014 – Apr 2019: Ph.D. Research - Software n/γ Discrimination Using Nonnegative Tensor Factorization (NTF) Algorithms**  
  - Applied Nonnegative Tensor Factorization (NTF) algorithms to extract independent components from signals recorded at the fission chamber preamplifier’s output, achieving software-based n/γ discrimination.  
  - Simulated neutron flux in the TRIGA Mark II reactor using Monte Carlo methods with Geant4 and Garfield++ to model the fission process, energy deposition, and ionization in the fission chamber.  
  - Integrated Magboltz and Heed within Garfield++ for analysis of electron-ion drift lines and induced signals, providing a detailed simulation of stochastic events and detector response.  
  - Processed output signals using the NTFLab toolbox in MATLAB®; identified NTF1 and NTF2 as the most effective algorithms for data analysis, achieving separation of neutron and γ-ray signals.  
  - Demonstrated successful n/γ discrimination without prior knowledge of signal mixture, validated by analyzing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and normalized correlation functions between pure neutron and γ-ray signals.
