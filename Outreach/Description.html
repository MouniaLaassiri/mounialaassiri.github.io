# Outreach
Research indicates that girls in Africa tend to lose interest in physics around the age of 12. **Mounia wants to change this.** After she attended the  
[African School of Physics](https://africanschoolofphysics.org) in 2016, 
(ASP2016) in Kigali, Rwanda. This journey with ASP,has been beneficial to me and the advancement of the ASP’s mission. I attended ASP in 2016 as a student and returned in 2022 as a lecturer.
I was appointed to the ASP IOC with immediate impact (I led the organization of the third African Conference on Fundamental and Applied Physics, ACP2023, and the eighth African School of Physics, ASP2024

One of the programs of ASP is an outreach event is organized for high school learners for a period of one week. 
The objective is to motivate learners to develop and maintain interest in physics and applications. 
Upwards of 200 learners  per day from the host country can participate in this program, and the participating learners 
are identified by the local organizing committee (LOC) in consultation with the Regional Educational Authorities around the venue. 

These a list of the ASP learners programs I have participated in:
* [ASP2024 High School](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1393743/)
    The high school program was planned for April 15-19 (when pupils will be in school) . We accommodated more than 1000 learners at 5 different venues as follows:
        *Marrakech: Monday 15 april
        *Chichaooua: Tuesday 16 april
        *Al Haouz:  Wednesday 17 april
        *Kalaat Sraghna: Thursday 18 april
        *Rehamna: Friday 19 april


* [ASP2022 High School](https://africanschoolofphysics.org/asp2022/), 
    This program was organized as an outreach event with hands-on activities in fundamental physics developed by QuarkNet and information on
    fundamental physics research based in Africa. The outreach activities, facilitated by the two QuarkNet staff members in the Teachers’ Program 
    and a group of ASP2022 Lecturers, included particle cards, cosmic muon experiment, particle-collision activities and questions and answers session. 
    The Q&A was especially motivating for students as they could ”ask anything” of physicists who were mostly young and mostly from Africa. 
    The program was repeated for four hours daily for five days for different groups of pupils from schools in and around Gqeberha. A total of 231 pupils attended.
