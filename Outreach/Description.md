# Outreach
Research indicates that girls in Africa tend to lose interest in physics around the age of 12. **Mounia wants to change this**. After attending the
[African School of Physics](https://africanschoolofphysics.org) (ASP2016) in Kigali, Rwanda in 2016, Mounia found this journey with ASP beneficial for both herself 
and the advancement of the ASP’s mission. She attended ASP in 2016 as a student and returned in 2022 as a lecturer. 
Mounia was appointed to the ASP IOC with immediate impact, where she led the organization of the third African Conference on Fundamental and Applied Physics (ACP2023)
and the eighth African School of Physics (ASP2024).

One of the programs of ASP is an outreach event organized for high school learners over a period of one week. 
The objective is to motivate learners to develop and maintain interest in physics and its applications. 
Upwards of 200 learners per day from the host country can participate in this program, and the participating 
learners are identified by the local organizing committee (LOC) in consultation with the Regional Educational Authorities around the venue.

Here is a list of the ASP learner programs I have participated in:
- **[ASP2024 High School](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1393743/)** <br /> 
    The high school program was planned for April 15-19 (when pupils will be in school). We accommodated more than 1,000 learners at five different venues as follows:
  - Marrakech: Monday 15 april
  - Chichaooua: Tuesday 16 april
  - Al Haouz:  Wednesday 17 april
  - Kalaat Sraghna: Thursday 18 april
  - Rehamna: Friday 19 april

    This program was organized as an outreach event with hands-on activities in fundamental physics developed by QuarkNet, along with information
    on fundamental physics research based in Africa. The outreach activities, facilitated by two QuarkNet staff members in the Teachers’ Program
    and a group of ASP2022 lecturers, included particle cards, a cosmic muon experiment, particle-collision activities, and a questions-and-answers session.
    The Q&A was especially motivating for students, as they could "ask anything" of physicists who were mostly young and primarily from Africa. The program was repeated 
    for four hours daily for five days for different groups of pupils from schools in and around Gqeberha, with a total of 231 pupils attending.
