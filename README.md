Hello! My name is Mounia, and I'm a curious and keen physicist currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) [ref.](https://www.bnl.gov/staff/mlaassiri), as part of the ATLAS collaboration on the testing of the ATLAS strip tracker upgrade (ITk) and the African School of Physics (ASP). I hold a Ph.D. in physics and nuclear instrumentation from Mohammed V University in Morocco, where I also earned a B.Sc. in fundamental studies and an M.Sc. in the security of computer networks and embedded systems.

I serve as a co-convener of the African Young Physicists Forum (YPF) within the African Strategy for Fundamental and Applied Physics (ASFAP). In this role, I organize young African physicists into YPF to address issues related to their career growth, supporting the mission of the African Physical Society. 

I'm also an editor of the African Physics Newsletter (APN), published quarterly by the American Physical Society (APS). Additionally, I have been appointed as a Trustee on the Board of Trustees of ASP and to the ASP International Organizing Committee (IOC). Recently, I was appointed to the Governing Council (GC) of the Arab Physical Society (ArPS).

Through my involvement in initiatives like the ASP, ASFAP, APN, and ArPS, I hope to continue mentoring the next generation of African and Arab physicists.
